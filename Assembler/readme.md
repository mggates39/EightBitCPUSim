This assempler is just a quick and dirty one.

Right now it has the souce code hard coded as if it had been parced into two 
segments.  One for code and another for data.  
The code segment has its origin at address zero.
The data segement's origin is at address 12

It is based on the file multipy.asm in the parent directory.
