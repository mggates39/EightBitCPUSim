# EightBitCPUSim
Simulation of [Ben Eater's 8 Bit CPU Build Project](https://eater.net/8bit)
# Background
A friend of mine was working on [Ben Eater's](https://eater.net) 8-Bit CPU Project, 
that implements an enhanced [SAP-1](https://deeprajbhujel.blogspot.com/2015/12/sap-1-architecture.html) architecture,  and they descided to 
create a [web based simulater](https://itwasscience.com/posts/cpupostone/) for the project

This is my take on the project.  Included is a simple assembler project that will output the textual binary for inclusion in the simmulator's cpu memory.
